# End-to-end multiclass dog breed classificationüê∂

This notebook builds an end-to-end multiclass image classifier using Tensorflow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub.

## 1. Problem
Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog.

## 2. Data
The data we're using is from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition.

## 3. Evaluation

Evaluation is a file with prediction probability.

## 4. Features

* We're dealing with unstructured data(images)
* We have to evaluate amongst 120 breeds of dogs(120 classes)

## 5. Results

* We were able to achieve a Multi Class Log Loss of 0.8964 using mobilenet_v2.
* We were also able to predict breeds on custom images.
